## Overview

Nova is a versatile streaming platform designed to bring you a diverse collection of movies right to your fingertips. Whether you're into the latest blockbusters or timeless classics, Nova has something for everyone. The platform has been completely rewritten using Vite.js, offering improved performance, faster development experience, and better code organization.

## Key Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Vite.js for lightning-fast development and optimal production builds

## Actively Maintained Fork

This project is an actively maintained fork of the original Nova. It continually evolves with new ideas and features, ensuring that your viewing experience remains fresh and engaging.

- **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**: Provides detailed movie information, including summaries, ratings, and more.
- **vidsrc.pro API**: Allows you to stream any movie you want, with a wide range of options to choose from.
